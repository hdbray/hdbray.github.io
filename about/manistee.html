	<h2>Manistee river, MI</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Late August, 2019</li>
	  <li>4 day/3 night canoe/kayak overnight</li>
	  <li>w/ Elena, Becca, Sally, Ed</li>
	</ul>
	<p> 
	Elena and I had been hoping for an excuse to get obsessed with
	canoeing for a while, and 
	Michigan got us officially hooked with its gorgeous
	rivers and lakes. 
	The Manistee was our first big camping trip in Michigan. 
	As always, I had a dangerous amount of fun researching and planning
	it. 
	Here's how it played out and what I might do differently next
	time.</p>
	<h3>Trip overview</h3>
	<p>We rented a canoe for Elena and me and a kayak for our friend
    Becca with <a href = "http://www.manisteerivertrips.com">Wilderness
      Canoe</a> in Mesick, MI. They shuttled our group (which included
    Elena's mom Sally, and Sally's boyfriend Ed and their kayaks which they
    own; it was a pretty substantial additional fee for them to get their
    boats shuttled) from the M-37 bridge to the M-66 bridge. We paddled
    about 20 hrs/100 miles at a comfortable pace back to Wilderness Canoe
    at M-37 bridge over 4 days with 3 nights of dispersed backcountry
    camping along the river. This part of the Manistee weaves through state
    forest  land, where dispersed camping is free (<a href =
      "https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79119_79145_81213_81220---,00.html">bring
      permits and learn more here</a>). We started on a Wednesday near the
    end of August and ended on a Saturday. The weather was gorgeous during
    the day, but cold at night, and we didn't have much company on the
    river.</p>
	<h3>More details</h3>
	<p><b>Day one</b> (~3.5 hrs paddling): Becca, Elena and I left Ann
	Arbor around 6:30 and got to Wilderness Canoe right at 10. Sally
	and Ed got a later start coming from Ludington State Park (they
	drove up the day before from St Louis). We were checked in and on
	the shuttle a little after 12, and started paddling from the M-66
	bridge put-in at 1:20. This was later than originally planned but
	stuff happens, always good to budget cushion time for that.</p> 
	<p>We paddled about 3 hours to the first bridge, Coster bridge.
	Along this stretch we saw our first bald eagle soar right over us -
	a great start to the trip. Maybe 30-45 minutes further downriver
	from Coster bridge we spotted a nice site on the left, in the crook
	of an elbow bend in the river. We pulled off here to set up camp
	for the night. We learned as the trip went on that a good indicator
	of a viable site is evidence of a previous campfire, especially if
	it's visible from the river. If you want to find this spot, there
	was a private home maybe 10 minutes before it on the left which
	seemed to be right next to a creek feeding the Manistee.</p>
	<p>This was one of the warmer days (highs in the high 70s/low 80s),
	so we took a swim along the river by our site. The water is crisp
	and really clean. In this upper stretch the river has mostly a
	sandy or pebble bottom with shallow areas and lots of pretty
	riffles. You can see to the bottom most of the time. It bends back
	and forth for the entire trip but it is narrower and more
	interesting to navigate at the upper part of the river.</p>
	<p> We had breakfast for dinner - scrambled eggs with veggies,
	dehydrated refried beans, turkey bacon, and english muffins (thanks
	Kelly and Joe for the awesome two burner stove). Ed got a fire
	going which kept the bugs at bay and Becca cracked open a couple
	tasty canned wines.  Stars were glorious. Sally and Ed slept right
	by the babbling river.</p>
	<p><b>Day two</b> (5.5-6 hrs paddling) We had a relaxed morning and
	got on the river at 10:40. I started to look out for sites in case
	there were any  better than ours. There were some inferior ones on
	the left for a bit and then a nice big open one also on the left,
	which was occupied by some fly fishermen. I'd guess this site is an
	hour south of Coster bridge.  </p>
	<p> Around that area the river splits temporarily, and if you stay
	to the right there is a small creek on the right. We filtered some
	water from this creek. There are a lot of creeks feeding the
	Manistee and the water is very clean. The guy who shuttled us says
	he drinks it straight no filter (not recommended but interesting)!
	</p>
	<p>An hour into our morning paddle we arrived at a take-out at
	Lucas bridge. Used the outhouse and took a snack break. We then
	surged ahead for about two hours and stopped next at the primitive
	Chase creek campground, on the left. There is clearly no
	maintenance here but we were able to pull our boats up and have a
	lunch break. The take-out area was very muddy.  This stretch of
	river was quiet and very pretty. Lots of fun riffles, the river is
	not very deep yet and still fairly narrow.</p>
	<p>Our next stop, about 1.5 hours downriver, is Chippewa Landing
	outfitters. They also rent canoes and kayaks and they shuttle folks
	up-river. If you want a shorter trip or to stick to the narrow,
	shallower parts of the river, renting/shuttling with and ending at
	Chippewa landing is probably a good move. You can put-in a little
	higher up river than we did as well, though water levels can be
	shallow (this is not really a problem for kayaks but might be for
	canoes weighed down with gear). Bob at Chippewa Landing kindly let
	us use their outhouses and shared a couple beers. We insisted on
	leaving him with $10 for his kindness.<p>
	<p>It takes longer than I expect to get from Chippewa Landing to
	our next stop, the Old US-131 state campground. There are lots of
	hooks at the Old US-131 campground take-out to tie up a boat, but
	it is tricky to get out and seems like it would be hard to unload
	and drag boats full of gear off the water here. We were happy to be
	camping along the river instead of choosing the option to
	pay/reserve a site at a state campground.</p>
	<p>We stopped here to use the outhouses and refill on water. The
	campground does look very nice and well-maintained so we would
	recommend it for car camping. We paddled another 30 minutes, just
	past the train bridge, before settling on a lovely site on the left
	of the river, again in the crook of a big elbow in the river. There
	were remnants of a fire that we spotted from the river, and a good
	area for unloading and pulling the boats in. The site was large,
	with a variety of trees spaced apart including big pines, and a
	soft pine needle ground. We were happy with the site that night,
	but unfortunately the next morning we could hear cars on the
	highway, probably US-131.  Before pulling in to the site, Ed and
	Becca saw what looked like a brown squirrel swimming in the river,
	which we later learned was a mink.</p>
	<p> The dinner this night was my favorite! We roasted some
	pre-chopped fajita veggies, which we served with black beans,
	cheddar, salsa, fresh diced tomatoes and cilantro, and tortillas.
	Sally, the river pro of the group, flipped a kayak over and used
	the bottom as a table for chopping up the tomatoes and cilantro.
	Thanks again to Kelly and Joe for lending us the two burner stove -
	this dinner would have been a real headache without that. One
	significant perk of overnight canoe camping is the option to pack a
	little heavier and bulkier than you could with a backpack or even a
	kayak. We like to make dinners more exciting for these sorts of
	trips.</p>
	<p>Ed got another fire going while we cooked dinner and Sally and I
	polished off the beers we obtained from Chippewa landing. We all
	appreciated Becca's scotcharoos for dessert, which held up well for
	the whole trip. Definitely a recommended camping treat. The stars
	were gorgeous yet again but this night got seriously cold. Our
	estimate given the weather data from Mesick and given how much
	colder it gets by the river is that the low was 36 degrees.  We
	were all chilly but Becca was especially cold in her hammock. Some
	of us decided the next night to sleep with nalgenes full of hot
	water in our sleeping bags. </p>
	<p><b>Day three</b> (~7 hours paddling): We were running slightly
	behind schedule because of the late start on the first day, so day
	three was the big make-up day. We got started at 10:40 after
	another slow morning and pulled off the river at the end of the day
	around 7:40. </p>
	<p>This part of the trip is more rustic, with fewer opportunities
	to stop and very few residential areas. We got very close to some
	deer, saw tons of flowers and butterflies along the banks, and
	watched another bald eagle soar overhead. The river is less narrow
	here and has more pools. It is not huge by any means and is still
	not very deep. There are shallow parts as well and still some
	pretty riffles. Most of our group, especially Sally who does a lot
	of whitewater kayaking, enjoyed the earlier, narrower stretch of
	the river which was shallow with abundant riffles. I think this
	rustic stretch which had a mix of both was my favorite.  I would
	like to plan better next time so we could appreciate this stretch.
	Elena and I talked about bringing blow-up inner tubes and towing
	each other for a little float next time, or stopping for a swim.
	The water is still very clean, and where the river deepens it
	becomes tinted teal instead of taking on the tan color of the sandy
	bottom.</p>

	<p> Three hours into our morning paddle, we arrived at Baxter
	bridge state campground. There are two take-out areas, and both of
	them are great for tying up boats but not great at all for getting
	out or unloading gear. We had lunch here, used the outhouses,
	refilled on water and carried on. Two hours beyond Baxter bridge we
	passed the high rollway, an overlook on the right side of the river
	which connects to the North Country Trail (NCT) and is accessible
	by car. It is not really accessible from the river. We paddled on
	with stops only for potty breaks and snacks. It is another two
	hours until we get to the fire lane, our goal for the day. This is
	the first access area you see after Baxter bridge.</p> 

	<p>Before the fire lane, there is limited camping along the river.
	Once we pass it, there seems to be quite a bit of camping. The
	sites are all high up along the bluffs of the river, which bound
	the river for most of this stretch. You can tell there is a site
	from the sandy run-off from the edge of a bluff into the river,
	which seems to be man-made and clearly receives a good bit of a
	foot traffic. 
<!--	In the picture above left, I am loading the
  canoe in this sandy area after our night camping on the bluffs. -->
	These camp sites are accessible by car, and many are occupied by
	tents or RVs. It's a Friday night and the weather is gorgeous, but
	we are still able to get a very nice site without trouble. It even
	has a homemade table which we enjoy.</p>

	<p>The views from our campsite on the bluff are gorgeous and make
	this night my favorite by far. I'd love to budget more time in
	future trips to appreciate this part of the river.  Unpacking the
	boats and pulling them up is definitely a pain, especially after a
	long day, but I think it was well worth the trouble. We have an
	easy dinner planned - prepared packaged veggie tikka masala with
	rice from Costco - and Ed gets another fire going soon enough to
	keep us warm as the sun goes down. </p>
	<p>In the future, if I have my own boats and/or manage to sort out
	a shuttle, I might stake out a good spot in this camping area and
	plant a car here at the start of the trip, so that we end the trip
	at one of these sites. At a minimum, I'd definitely try to budget
	more time for hanging out here. The views are stunning and it's a
	nice place to swim in the river. </p>
	<p><b>Day four</b> (~3.5 hours paddling): After another chilly
	night we got started around 10:15. Day four was the sprint to the
	finish. I did slow us down at one point - it was getting hot and we
	were doing well on time, so I dropped in the river for a float with
	the seat cushion that Wilderness canoe provided. The river was deep
	at times but also had moments where it was shallow enough that I
	could climb back in without turning the boat. I still managed to
	cause trouble though after I'd gotten back in the boat... I dropped
	my sunglasses in the water and lept out of the boat to save them,
	which did not make Elena happy!! The canoe didn't flip, but we
	would've been ok even if it did because (nearly) all of our things
	were in dry bags clipped to the canoe (very important
	precaution).</p>
	<p>We stopped at the Harvey bridge take-out about 2 hours into the
	paddle. We just sat and ate lunch by the parking area and watched
	some boaters put in before surging ahead. After Harvey bridge, the
	river is much wider and deeper. There are no longer any shallow
	sandy bottoms, nor are there soft riffles. It is very quiet and
	pretty here. We paddled efficiently and made it to the take-out at
	Wilderness canoe after only 90 minutes. </p>

	<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
	<p>Overall, I highly recommend this river for overnight trips. No
	portages, and the river is beautiful, clean and reasonable to
	navigate with a boat full of gear. It's got a good current if you
	just want to float, but it's not difficult. We really liked
	everything we paddled up to Harvey bridge at the very end, and
	would love to do it again.</p> 
	<p>If you think you might want to replicate a trip like this, you
	will need to be well-outfitted (mentally and physically) for rustic
	backcountry camping,  you will need to have paddled at least a
	little before, and you best be open-minded to getting your feet wet
	in some cold but refreshing water!  Also, if you and your
	significant other/family member have never paddled in the same
	canoe together before, it's probably in everyones best interests
	that you stick to single kayaks. (Yes this is a fine river for
	beginners, but it is interesting enough to be challenging for a
	beginner, and being weighed down with gear makes it harder to make
	quick turns. There are a lot of downed trees and occasional shallow
	spots that need to be avoided, and the narrow stretch at the
	beginning makes these obstacles more challenging.) </p>
	<p><b>Pack in dry bags.</b> We packed (nearly) everything in dry
	bags, some of which are very large, and can accommodate bulky stuff
	like tents, sleeping bags etc. Don't be naive and leave the dry
	bags behind - even if you are experienced and unlikely to flip a
	boat, there are obstacles like downed trees on this river that can
	surprise you, and some of the stopping points have difficult
	  take-out areas.  Elena scored some used dry bags on facebook
		marketplace, but these can get quite expensive if purchased
		new (eg <a href =
		  "https://www.rei.com/product/784169/sealline-black-canyon-boundary-dry-pack-115-liters">115
		  L dry backpack</a>). Some outfitters rent these huge
		ones, but you should not use huge ones if you are in a
		kayak. Only a canoe can accommodate these. In all cases,
		you will also want several smaller ones for personal items,
		clothes, and food. REI does rent dry bags, and many
		universities have outing clubs which rent gear, sometimes
		including dry bags. </p>
	<p> Of the items on <a href="/outdoors/manistee_packing.pdf">our
	  packing list</a>, we were especially happy to have bungee cords
	and short rope to tie up boats when docking, and a big sponge to
	soak up puddles and mud from the bottom of the boats (Sally always
	brings one). I wish I had brought a bandana to soak in river water
	and help cool me off while paddling. Elena wishes she brought a
	warm hat. I should've brought long underwear.</p>
	<p>I planned very carefully the areas where we could camp and what
	landmarks to look out for. I used a medley of maps and satellite
			images and resources, including Wilderness Canoe's
			<a href =
			  "http://www.manisteerivertrips.com/hours-pricing/">hours</a>
			and <a href=
			  "http://www.manisteerivertrips.com/map/">map</a>,
			<a href =
			  "http://midnr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Viewer/index.html?appid=1c46dfdb716042f7ad99866aa5d099bf">Michigan's
			  interactive state forest map</a> to find areas to
			  camp, <a href =
			  "https://nct.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Viewer/index.html?appid=23a2c0d674cb443ea9835af2e8c5f13a">
			    topolographical maps of the NCT</a> which
			  follows the Manistee south of the US 131 bridge,
			  and the book <a href =
			    "https://www.amazon.com/Canoeing-Michigan-Rivers-Comprehensive-Updated/dp/1933272333">Canoeing
			    Michigan Rivers by Dennis and Date </a> which I
			  checked out from the local library. I merged all
			  this information into <a
			  href="/outdoors/manistee_map.pdf">my own
			annotated map</a> and laminated it at office max
		      for use on the river. We did manage to camp in all
		      the designated areas I marked on my map each night.
		      It is nice that on a river, you are rarely lost and
		      you do not need to constantly keep eyes peeled for
		      trail markers. The map was mostly to keep track of
		      landmarks and estimated paddle times between stops,
		      as well as which areas were ok for camping. I don't
		      trust my memory with all that information.</p>
	<p>My only request is please, don't be like the assholes that left
	trash and toilet paper littered in campsites. Bury all human waste
	as appropriate and come prepared to do so.  Leave the site cleaner
	than when you arrived. Follow standard leave no trace guidelines in
	the backcountry. Appreciate and respect the beauty around you. Take
	it easy and have fun!</p>
