	<h2>Outdoor stuff</h2>
	<h2>Pinckney Recreation Area, MI</h2>
	<p>
	Pinckney is only a 45 minute drive from Ann Arbor but doesn't feel
	like it. There is a lot of hiking but this is probably better for
	mountain bikers and paddlers. Make sure you have a rec pass or buy
	a day pass at Halfmoon lake or Silver lake. 

	We took our canoe out to the chain of lakes several times. Our
	friends rented kayaks with 
	<a

	</a>
	with put-in at Bruin lake campground, which is a great
	starting point. Paddled from here up to Watson, Patterson, and then
	Woodburn lake. We went up Portage creek, paddled upstream without
	effort, and weaved through the marshy area until the tree line (at
	which point the mosquitos came out and drove us to turn around).
	Next time we'll have to check out the other creek feeding Woodburn
	lake. 

	The backcountry campground at Blind lake is a lovely space to stop. Sites at
	only reservable for one night at a time so it should be a quiet
	place to pull up for lunch. The channel between Hi-land lake and
	Halfmoon lake is very peaceful and pretty. Lots of fishing boats
	out and about. Go early in the AM to beat the traffic and avoid
	dealing with a lot of wake from motor boats. 

	We hope to try paddling from Hi-land lake to Portage lake sometime,
	along a longer stretch of creek which I know nothing about. 
	Might self-shuttle with my bike.
