          <h2>Outdoor stuff</h2>

	<h2>Baxter State Park, ME</h2>

	<h3>June 2016</h3>
	<p>Baxter state park in Maine is most famous for Mt. Katahdin, the
	terminus of the Appalacian trail. It has some extremely challenging
	hikes like the Knife Edge, a scenic ridge trail, and the Cathedral
	trail, which I hear is basically rock climbing. Katahdin is
	gorgeous and should be on the bucket-list of any outdoor
	enthusiast, but we've discovered other parts of Baxter which are
	very much also worth visiting, including our favorite campsite all
	time at South Branch Pond. Here's what we did while we were there.
	</p>
	<h3>Hiking Katahdin</h3>
	<p> We had a pleasant overnight stay the night before visiting
	Baxter at the quaint Parks Edge Inn, in Millinocket ME. The next
	morning we were at the entrace to Baxter very early. I don't
	remember exactly how early but I think it was definitely earlier
	than 6:30am. We arrived and hiked up to Chimney Pond, which takes
	about two hours. We had a reservation that night at Chimney Pond,
	but couldn't leave our stuff because it was occupied still in the
	morning when we passed by. If we had planned our trip earlier we
	would prefer to reserve two nights, but this worked out just fine.
	</p> 
	<p>The Knife's edge was closed and we didn't want to hike Cathedral
	with all our camping gear, so we opted for the Saddle trail on the
	way up, and Hamlin Ridge on the way down. This is still a strenuous
	hike, especially with all your gear. The summit is spectacular.
	Hamlin Ridge is very underrated! It is a longer journey than Saddle
	and seems to be less traveled, but the ridgeline views make it a
	great choice for the hike down. The total mileage for the day was 9
	miles. With the crazy early wake-up, we went at a reasonable pace,
	took breaks as desired, and arrived to Chimney Pond comfortably at
	early dinner time. What a gorgeous camping area. The lean-to's are
	very nice.  </p>
	<h3>South Branch Pond</h3>
	<p>As stunning as Katahdin is, the highlight of Baxter State Park
	for us was camping at South Branch pond. The northern part of the
	park is very quiet compared to Katahdin, and there was little
	competition for campsite reservations. There are some very pretty
	lean-to's right on the pond for car camping, but our absolute
	favorite campsite anywhere all time is the hike-in/canoe-in lean-to
	maybe a half mile from the main campgrounds. There is a very
	reasonable honor-code fee to reserve canoes at the campground. You
	can then throw all your things in a boat and paddle up to the site.
	Complete privacy. The site itself and the views of the Traveler
	loop ridgeline are idyllic.  </p>
	<p>There is plenty to entertain you on this pond if you rent a
	canoe. There is a ledge for cliff jumping (nothing too crazy),
	there is a hike following Howe brook which feeds the pond, along
	which there are cold refreshing pools forming under small
	waterfalls that are perfect for swimming. Some lakes in Baxter do
	have leeches but South Branch is not one of them. There is a gentle
	hiking trail that circumnavigates the pond, and if you are more
	ambitious, there is the infamous Traveler Loop, which some say is
	more strenuous than the Katahdin hikes. The 10 mile ridgeline hike
	is recommended for the fall because of intense heat and difficulty,
	so we did not attempt it during our June trip. We look forward to
	the opportunity to return, spend more time at our favorite South
	Branch lean-to, and take on the Traveler Loop.  </p>
