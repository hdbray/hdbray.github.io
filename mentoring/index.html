      <h3>Undergraduate research</h3>

      <p>
      Some undergraduate research projects I've led include:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li> Winter 2020: With Giuseppe Martone, I co-supervised the
	  LoG(M) project, <strong>entropy degeneration of ideal projective
	    pants</strong>. Grad mentor: Mitul Islam. Undergraduate
	  researchers: Marianne DeBrito, Andrew Nguyen, and Marisa O'Gara. 
	  <br>
	  [<a

	</li>
	<li> Fall 2019: I supervised the LoG(M) project, <strong>growth
	    rates of tent maps</strong>. Grad mentor: Yiwang Chen.
	  Undergraduate researchers: Robert Buckley, Grace O'Brien, and Zoe
	  Zhou.

	</li>
	  <li> Fall 2018: I supervised the <a
	      href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/logm/">LoG(M)</a> project,
	    <strong>modeling convex projective geometries</strong> 
	    <br> Grad mentors: Samantha Pinella and <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/robert-m-walker/home">Robert Walker</a>
	    <br> Undergrad researchers: Rudreshwaran Ranganathan, Steven
	    Schaefer, and Hanissa Shamsuddin
	    <br>

	  </li>
	  <li> Summer 2017: I mentored <strong>Jenny Natalia
	      Jones-Baro</strong> at the Michigan REU program. Jenny
	    collaborated with REU student <strong>Adam Holeman</strong>,
	    who was mentored by my fellow postdoc <a
	  href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cjashley/index.html">Caleb
	  Ashley</a>. <br> Jenny and Adam's REU write-up: <a
      href="https://lsa.umich.edu/content/dam/math-assets/math-document/Adam%20Holeman%20and%20Jennifer%20Jones-Baro.pdf">Random
      Walks on the Fundamental Group of the Once Punctured Torus</a>. </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Other</h3>

      <!--
      <p>
      As part of my leadership role with LoG(M), I provide postdocs with
      opportunities for research mentoring experience, and strive to create
      a supportive environment where they can have success as new mentors
      of undergraduate research.  I offer to meet with any postdocs
      interested in leading a project, and together we discuss their
      project ideas, covering topics such as difficulty level,
      computability, necessary background for students, developing
      resources, and shaping the project goal.

      <br> <br>
      -->

      <p>
      I am not a formal advisor of these students, but I enjoyed
      talking with Mitul Islam, Samantha Pinella, and
      Feng Zhu during the overlap of their time as graduate students and my
      time as a postdoc at the University of Michigan.

      <h3> The Lab of Geometry at Michigan </h3>

      <p>
      I was the director of the <a
	href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/logm/">Lab of Geometry at Michigan</a> -
      LoG(M) from summer 2017 to spring 2020.

      <br><br>

      LoG(M) is an undergraduate math research program. It is part of the
      <a href="http://geometrylabs.net/">Geometry Labs United</a> network.
      The lab runs 3-4 projects per semester with emphasis on computation
      and visualization as media for engaging undergraduates in modern
      mathematical research. Each project is led by 1-2 faculty supervisors
      with assistance from 1-2 graduate student mentors, and 3-4
      undergraduate researchers.

      <br> <br>

      My role as director of LoG(M) included the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li> recruiting and supporting project mentors </li>
	<li> recruiting and mentoring qualified undergraduate researchers</li>
	<li> developing students' computing and communication skills </li>
	<li> providing feedback to students on written material </li>
	<li> leading projects </li>
      </ul>
