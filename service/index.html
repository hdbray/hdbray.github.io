      I coorganized the conference LG&TBQ+   (<a
	href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~kent/LG&TBQ.html">webpage</a>) with
      <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~kent/">Autumn Kent</a>.  

      <br><br>

      I am openly transgender. I transitioned in 2017, during the first
      year of my postdoc at the University of Michigan.  I would be happy
      to hear from other queer/LGBTQIA+ mathematicians - please don't
      hesitate to reach out.

      <br><br>

      I am the current director of <a
	 href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/logm/">LoG(M), the Lab of
	 Geometry at Michigan</a>. Please direct any questions related to
       LoG(M) to logm-info [at] umich [dot] edu.


       <br><br>

       Some commmunity outreach programs I have been involved with:

       <ul>
	 <li> <a href="https://wolverinepathways.umich.edu/">Wolverine
	     Pathways</a>. In Fall 2017 I ran three math circles for 8th and
	   11th graders in Detroit area school districts.</li>
	 <li> <a href="http://femmes.studentorgs.umich.edu/">FEMMES</a>
	   (Females Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and the
	   Sciences). I have run math activities for 4th-6th grade girls
	   at the twice-annual Capstone events from Fall 2016 to
	   present.</li>
	 <li> <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/urop">Undergraduate
	     Research Opportunities Program (UROP)</a> at Michigan.
	   Beginning Fall 2017, as director of LoG(M), I began
	   advertising LoG(M) to UROP students and admitting UROP
	   students to LoG(M) projects.</li>
	 <li> <a
	  href="https://sites.google.com/site/tuftsogsm/awm">Tufts
	  Student Chapter of the Association for Women in
	  Mathematics</a>. As a graduate student, I was a cofounder
	and president of the Tufts AWM student chapter. I helped
	organize outreach activities at local high schools  and
	brought a guest panel of women in mathematics from the
	greater Boston area to Tufts to share their experience and
	advice.</li>
	 <li> <a href="http://www.girlsangle.org/">Girl's Angle</a>
	   is a Cambridge based non-profit which provides a safe
	   space for middle and high school girls to explore
	   mathematics. As president of the Tufts AWM, I brought
	   Somerville High School students to Tufts University for
	   an afternoon of math activities led by Girl's Angle
	   president Kenneth Fan and assisted by members of the
	   Tufts AWM group.</li>
	 <li> <a href="http://sites.tufts.edu/poincare/">The
	     Poincare Institute for Math Education</a>.</li>
